### Rebrandly API Request

> This code uses Javascript to make AJAX api request.

The API request is written in both traditional Javascript AJAX ES4 and new `async`/`await` functionality developed in ES6(promises) and ES8 respectively.

> Promises are a new type of JavaScript object that represent data that will eventually be returned from a request.

#### How to use the code:
* Add the API key from Rebrand.ly website to `main.js` file inside public and it should work like a magic :)
* Remove one of the shortenUrl AJAX functions
